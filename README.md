## What is implemented:

- Search by records
- Dynamic display of the number of posts and the number of likes
- Adding new / removing old
- Ability to like posts (by clicking on the span, well, on the words of the post)
- Ability to highlight an entry with an asterisk (mark as important)
- Filter posts by likes / by all posts (implemented dynamically, i.e. the ability to add new buttons to filter and post new types and filter by them)

### Update of 30.05.2021:

So the list of changes:
1. - A small redesign, bringing the app to life with the simplest animations.
2. - Added automatic generation and saving of the post date.
3. - Added the ability to sort entries by date - for the current day, the current week, the current month and older than the month.
4. - Sorting works in conjunction with filtering, you can sort entries for a week and filter them by likes or other available criteria.
